# vim-tomorrow-theme

An active fork of Tomorrow based on work by @chriskempson.

This fork is a merge between chriskempson/vim-tomorrow-theme and chriskempson/tomorrow-theme.

The branch `merge` is simply a rebase of tomorrow-theme onto vim-tomorrow-theme.

The branch `master` contains everything in `merge`, plus new commits from me that appear in neither of the original repos.
